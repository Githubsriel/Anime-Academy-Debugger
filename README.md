# Anime Academy Debugger

## Overview
The **Anime Academy Debugger** is a Tampermonkey userscript designed to enhance your experience on the Anime Academy chat platform. It provides a suite of debugging tools, including real-time logging of chat events, a spam module, and a display of your current Socket ID. This script is particularly useful for developers or power users who want to monitor and interact with the chat system more effectively.

## Features
- **Real-time Event Logging**: Logs `DOM`, `EMIT`, and `RECV` events in a structured and easy-to-read format.
- **Spam Module**: Allows you to send repeated messages at a customizable interval.
- **Socket ID Display**: Shows your current Socket ID, which is useful for debugging connection issues.
- **Draggable Debugger Interface**: A resizable and movable debugger window for convenient access.

2. Create a new script in Tampermonkey and paste the provided code into the editor.

## Usage
### Debugger Interface

### Event Logging
- The debugger logs three types of events:

  - **EMIT**: Events emitted by your socket.
  - **RECV**: Events received by your socket.
- Each event is timestamped and displayed in a scrollable section.

- **Start Spam**: Click the "Start Spam" button to begin sending the message repeatedly.
- **Stop Spam**: Click the "Stop Spam" button to stop the spam.

### Socket ID Display
- The current Socket ID is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen.
- If the socket is not connected, it will display "Socket ID: Not Connected".

## Customization

- **Styling**: Customize the appearance of the debugger by modifying the `Object.assign` styles in the script.
